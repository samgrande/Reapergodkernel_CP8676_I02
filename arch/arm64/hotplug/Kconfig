           CPU hotplug driver designed for ARM big.LITTLE systems where
           both the big and little CPUs are of the same type. On these
           systems, it preferable to normall use the big cluster, and
           only activate the little cluster for highly parallel loads.
           This hotplug implementation always keeps the big cluster
           online, and only activates the little cluster for heavy
           parallel loads.
